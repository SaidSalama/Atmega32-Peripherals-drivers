# Atmega32-Peripherals-drivers
It is the MCAL drivers for some important peripherals of the atmga32 microcontroller
## How it is done ?
Each peripheral driver consists of a header file with the preprocessing data and the function declarations
and a c file that includes the defintions of the functions to use the peripheral
these files are developped according to the Datasheet of the AVR microcontrollers
## Datasheet
you can find the datasheet of the microcontroller by this link
